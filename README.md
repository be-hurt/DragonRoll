# dragonroll
A working prototype of a Dungeons and Dragons 5e character creator and manager. This is a re-skin of an earlier project done for school. 
Made with PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Dragonroll is a Dungeons and Dragons 5e character creator and manager. It uses the Systems Reference Document (SRD) that is available under
the Open-Gaming Licence (OLG) provided by Wizards of the Coast for its content. The purpose of the site is to enable quick and easy character generation for 
new players to the game by abstracting away many of the complexities (and math) involved in the process. A more complete and maintainable version
of the site is in the works.
